 yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
 you kept your friendship with our friend:
 your chorus, is it dead for ever?
 your soul displays, in holy dreams,
 youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
 Yes, spleen was waiting like a sentry,
 Yes, youth divines, in giddy madness,
 Yet -- fear itself she found presented
 You husbands, deeply I respect you!
 ``You pile one eclogue on another!
 Your curiosity is burning
 ``You're off? why, there's a poet for you!''
 ``You're wrong.'' ``But what I wonder at
 ``Your modish world, I'll do without it;
 You too, mamas, I pray attend it,
 years back, to call up many a fable;
 yes, even there its triumph grows.
 yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
 yes, these were our forefathers' ways,
 yet, as each rule has its exception,
 yet he fell out of love at last
 yet how I wish that I might raise
 you'd made appearance in my dreaming;
 you'd not so much as know the name,
 you drink the magic draught of yearning,
 you find the country godforsaken;
 you gave me such a shocking fright!
 you help him to an honoured fate
 you know I'm hard to comprehend...
 you learn life's sweetness, and with this
 you left no steps that could be tracked:
 you'll never leave me to my fate.
 you'll recognize him soon enough, --
 you loved the opulent contact
 you newborn work, and like a winner
 your early life, unlock your tongue:
 you're really going? Well, I'm sad.
 you're sure to find her portrait in it:
 your pride, some answer, or in truth
 youth is a fever; we must spare
 youth which has nothing to regret,
 you were the first ones he forswore;
 Yet hissing froth deals a malicious,
 Yet once for him her thoughts had whirled,
 Yet sweeter far, at such a time,
 Yet Tanya's note made its impression
 Yet the mazurka keeps today
 You'd never class her as a beauty;
 ``You don't see what to do? that's funny:
 You'll love again, but you must teach
 Young ladies jump for future blisses...
 Your horse, blunt-shoed and all unwary,
 You too, prime beauties in your flower
 yes, in that spring-time, in low-lying
 you age, and life's just grief and sadness...''
 you in my arms on gingerbread?''
 you made me drunk as one could ask!
 you object of my guileless ditties!
 your battles, lawless and atrocious,
 your heels will squash the ladies' toes! >
 your heroes, raging and ferocious,
 your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
 ``You wrote to me, and nothing spoken
 ``You yawn, Onegin?'' ``As I'm used to.''
 yet a capricious inclination,
 yet floods of talk around the town...
 yet he'd back you through thick and thin:
 yet people's malice and suspicion
 you called there twice, and since then took
 you'll read: here's Pradt,7 here's Walter Scott!
 your dashing one, is she surviving?''
 your grief would fail to touch my heart,
 your heart some self-restraint; for each
 your loved one, honourable reader!
 your night of fretting's left no trace!
 your tears would flow -- but your emotion,
 your Zeus, your Cypris, your whole band
 you see the two in uniform...
 you see your fated tempter stand.
 ``You're ill, God have you in his keeping,
 you're all in fever... heavens above.''
 you too have seen on Neva's brink.
 you've made so many secret rhymes,
 ``You know, it's true, how I attended,
 you've paid insanity its due.
 you won't find that quite so much catch...
      ``You criticize Moscow? why make such a fuss
 young poet, be for ever blest!''
 your advent swamps me in its flood!
 your presence aches, and in my blood!
 ``You know him, do you?'' ``Yes and no.''
 yet dared not trust what I could see.

 your matchlessness, to seek to capture
 yourself too long from social life.''

 You've guessed before it all began:
 you acted well, that dread occasion,
 young Tanya first appeared to me,
 your cold discourse, were less unkind --
 your icy look, your stern dissuasion,
 your Tanya's image in your mind,
 you see, with tears and incantation
 you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
 you took an honourable part --
